# Business Launchpad

Repository for the Founders Program project "Business Launchpad". June 2019

## Context
Business Launchpad aims to support young entrepreneurs (16-30) through running free workshops and mentoring sessions with groups and individuals. Part of their work involves collecting and digitizing information related to each individualâ€™s journey in order to both better support them and to inform the future direction of the organization.
Business Launchpad came to us asking for an app that would help to facilitate their data collection while also providing something that would be useful for young entrepreneurs. Most of their data is held on Salesforce, often coming through forms created with Form Assembly.

## The App
In this first iteration, it functions as a tool to save, view, and check off goals related to their business journeys, particularly when used in conjunction with BL mentors. It also offers the capacity to record reflections upon completing goals, and a resources page hosted on Airtable that is editable by BL employees.
